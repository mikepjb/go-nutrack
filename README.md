# nutrition

An implementation of my food calculator in Golang.

It works out how much nutrition you get for a given meal and how much it costs.
It will also aggregate that across a week and tell you what ingredients you'll
need to buy.

### TODO

Include vitamins and minerals e.g chives have little macronutritional value but
a tablespoon provides vitamin K, calcium, magnesium etc..
